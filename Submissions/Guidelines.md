**Welcome to the First Challenge of CodeWithCoffe. This is a chance for all those who are interested about web technologies and want to show case their skills.
It's important to note that this is by no means a test. Our team here  just wants to get a sense of what you can do with what's given.**

**Instructions for Submission**

As developers we rely heavily on tools like Github.
Please fork this repository and use your clone for developing the challenge. 
When complete, submit a pull request with your changes for our team to review.
Please maintain a proper hierarchical order


**Guidelines**

You are encouraged to be creative and use any coding techniques you have in your arsenal. 
We want to emphasize that the translation of the instruction provided into code is open to your interpretation. 
That said, here are a few guidelines that must be followed:

    * It is only necessary to develop the HTML Page.
    * Comment your code appropriately.
    * Include all your development or source files.
    
**What We Are Looking For**
 
 We expect clean, valid, and semantic HTML page.
 Is your code commented? What is your code doing and, more importantly, why?
 Did you use JavaScript properly? Did you author it ?
 We expect helpful Git commit messages, a clean history, and use of branching.
