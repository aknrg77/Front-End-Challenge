## Front End Challenge

Aki wants to plan the first ever developers meetup in JUIT. As plannings stack up, he thinks that a todo list app might help him manage the event better. 

He thinks of developing a simple ToDo List App. Now he has nothing created but only plans and requirements. But he lacks the skills for developing it. Since he has a lot of work to do for successfully organizing the developers meet over coffee in hackerden, he can't learn the required skills so soon.


You may **develop the solutions in groups**.
