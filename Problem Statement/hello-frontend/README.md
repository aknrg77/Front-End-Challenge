## Front End Challenge

Aki wants to plan the first ever developers meetup in JUIT. As plannings stack up, he thinks that a todo list app might help him manage the event better. 

He thinks of developing a simple ToDo List App. Now he has nothing created but only plans and requirements. But he lacks the skills for developing it. Since he has a lot of work to do for successfully organizing the developers meet over coffee in hackerden, he can't learn the required skills so soon.


You may **develop the solutions in groups**.

## Task 
Her Aki by developing a simple frontend for ToDo list app.


### Level 0 - Easy - Let's Get Started!

First things first!  We need to set up the project. Create a folder called todo and open this within your text editor. We need an html file, a css file and a JS file for this project. Go ahead and create those!

`mkdir todo`
`cd todo/`
`subl index.html`
`subl main.css`
`scripts.js`

### Level 1 - Easy - Basic HTML tags and CSS properties.

Level 1 (HTML basics)
There you go! You've created your files, now let's do some work now! 
Open your html file and do the following:
1) Create a web page with the title CodeWithCoffee ToDo App. 
2) Add a CodeWithCoffee logo and a heading for the same. (Center Aligned) 
3) Create a link at the bottom named 'how to use' to another page titled 'Instructions'. 
4) Instructions page: 
    (i) Add logo and heading
    (ii) Write a paragraph describing how to use the web  app. You can also use ordered list for the same. 
    (iii) Create a link named 'back' to get back to the app.
